# 🚀 Lightspeed Inventory Dashboard - Presentation Summary

## 🎯 **The Problem You're Solving**
- **Current Lightspeed Limitation**: No way to filter inventory by sizes
- **Business Pain Points**: 
  - Can't quickly find "all Large t-shirts" or "size 10 sneakers"
  - Inefficient inventory management for size-based products
  - Lost sales opportunities due to poor size visibility

## 💡 **The Solution**
**Custom size-based inventory dashboard** that connects to Lightspeed API and provides:
- **Instant size filtering** (S, M, L, XL for clothing / 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 for shoes)
- **Real-time stock alerts** for low/out-of-stock items
- **Brand and category filtering**
- **Beautiful, intuitive interface**

## 🔥 **Demo Highlights** (Use Real Outlined.ca Data!)

### **Opening Hook** (30 seconds)
- "What if I told you that in 30 seconds, I can show you every Nike Kobe 6 in size 10 that's in stock, plus all your FOG Essentials hoodies in Large?"
- Open the demo → Show immediate size filtering

### **Key Demo Flow** (3-4 minutes):

1. **📊 Dashboard Overview**
   - Show stats: 17 real products, $3,400+ inventory value

2. **👟 Size Filtering Magic**
   - Click "9" → Shows Nike Kobe 6 + Dunk Low "Panda" in size 9
   - Click "L" → Shows FOG hoodies + Purple Brand tees in Large
   - "This is what Lightspeed can't do natively"

3. **⚡ Real Business Value**
   - Show low stock alerts (Kobe 6 size 10 has only 1 left!)
   - Show out-of-stock items (Purple Brand jeans size 30)
   - "Prevent lost sales by knowing what's running low"

4. **🔍 Advanced Features**
